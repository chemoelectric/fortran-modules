Regarding my use of m4
----------------------

I use m4 to generate source code, but the generated source code is
meant to be treated as the ‘actual’ Fortran source. You do not need to
have or run m4 just to use the Fortran code.

Using m4 not only makes some tasks much easier, but reduces the
opportunity for coding errors. And it is much more powerful than the C
preprocessor (cpp or fpp); it is a true macroprocessor, and is
standard on POSIX systems.
