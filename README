Fortran modules for general programming
---------------------------------------

unused_variables.f90   -- A way to quiet some warnings. Not
                          necessarily the most efficient method.

garbage_collector.f90  -- Garbage collection for Fortran.
                          (Expat license)
                          (Under development)

boxes.f90              -- Boxes for Fortran, in the manner of
                          Scheme Request for Implementation 111
                          (SRFI-111).
                          (Expat license)
                          (Under development)

cons_pairs.f90         -- CONS-pairs for Fortran, in the manner of
                          Scheme Request for Implementation 1
                          (SRFI-1).

Regarding my use of m4
----------------------

I use m4 to generate source code, but the generated source code is
meant to be treated as the ‘actual’ Fortran source. You do not need to
have or run m4 just to use the Fortran code.

Using m4 not only makes some tasks much easier, but reduces the
opportunity for coding errors. And it is much more powerful than the C
preprocessor (cpp or fpp); it is a true macroprocessor, and is
standard on POSIX systems.
