Fortran modules for general programming
---------------------------------------

Let us consider these modules to be of ‘alpha’ quality, unless I say
something such as ‘Under development’ next to the module’s description
here. But they are meant for you to take them as source code and
modify them as you like.

garbage_collector.f90  -- Garbage collection for Fortran.
                          (Expat license)

boxes.f90              -- Boxes for Fortran, in the manner of
                          Scheme Request for Implementation 111
                          (SRFI-111).
                          (Expat license)

cons_pairs.f90         -- CONS-pairs for Fortran, in the manner of
                          Scheme Request for Implementation 1
                          (SRFI-1).
                          (Expat license)

lsets.f90              -- Lsets (lists as sets) for Fortran,
                          in the manner of Scheme Request for
                          Implementation 1 (SRFI-1).
                          (Expat license)

vectars.f90            -- Vectors (single-dimensional arrays) for
                          Fortran, in the manner of Scheme Request
                          for Implementation 133 (SRFI-133). We
                          call them ‘vectar’ for ‘vector array’.
                          (Expat license)

sorting_and_selection.f90 -- Sorting routines for CONS-pair lists and
                          vectars, in the manner of Scheme Request
                          for Implementation 132 (SRFI-132).
                          (Expat license)


Regarding my use of m4
----------------------

I use m4 to generate source code, but the generated source code is
meant to be treated as the ‘actual’ Fortran source. You do not need to
have or run m4 just to use the Fortran code.

Using m4 not only makes some tasks much easier, but reduces the
opportunity for coding errors. And it is much more powerful than the C
preprocessor (cpp or fpp); it is a true macroprocessor, and is
standard on POSIX systems.
